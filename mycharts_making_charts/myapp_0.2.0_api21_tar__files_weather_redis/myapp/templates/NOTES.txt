{{ include "myapp.name" . }}
Above is the myapp.name and it is the chart name by default
_helpers.tpl nameOverride will override this name with the override name
This is the myapp.name in the _helpers.tpl file

{{include "myapp.fullname" . }}
Above is the fully qualified app name used by kubernetes
This is myapp.fullname in the _helpers.tpl file
The logic is .Release.Name but if the $name is not a subset of the .Release.Name use the .Release.Name-$name
as the fully  qualified name
Example: the release name is test: helm install test . --dry-run, and the $name is myapp
In the example the  final fully qualified name myapp.fullname would be test-myapp

{{include "myapp.chart" . }}
This is myapp.chart and is the chart name and version as used by teh chart label.

{{include "myapp.labels" . }}
This is the myapp.labels and is the name and version of the chart and the generation service (always Helm)

{{include "myapp.serviceAccountName" . }}
This is the myapp.serviceAccountName. This will be the same as the myapp.fullname above if no serviceAccountName 
is in the values.yaml file.
